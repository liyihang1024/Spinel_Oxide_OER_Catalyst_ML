# Spinel_Oxide_OER_Catalyst_ML
This project aims to optimize spinel oxide electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction (OER), vital in water electrolysis and hydrogen production. We use a mix of high-throughput DFT calculations and machine learning to systematically enhance spinel oxide performance for OER efficiency.
